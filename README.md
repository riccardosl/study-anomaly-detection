# Anomaly detection: supporting evidence on Neural Networks

## Objective

The main goal of the current research is to study the available documentation related to applications of deep learning in anomaly detection. 
Different machine learning techniques were tested and compared to add more data in the current landscape. The anomaly detection is categorized as a problem of unsupervised learning.

As a reference point we studied a research published in 2018 on the page of Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) with title “Enhanced Network Anomaly Detection Based on Deep Neural Networks”. Authors of this paper are Sheraz Naseer, Yasir Saleem, Shehzad Khalid, Muhammad Khawar Bashir, Jihun Han, Muhammad Munwar Iqbal and Kijun Han.
